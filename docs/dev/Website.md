#### Medusa
##### Next.js
React itself is just a library without router, module bundler or server etc...

If you want to create react app without installing tons of packages/modules you can just create it with create-react-app but it's just frontend framework without backend server, router and etc..

Next.js solves this and it's probably new standard for making React applications cuz it's the simplest way without tons of thinking about which packages will you use.... Next.js adds very good router, image and link components, backend server with serverless functions and many more..

I hope I'm correct :)
